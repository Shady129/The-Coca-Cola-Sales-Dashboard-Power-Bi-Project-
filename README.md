# 🥤 COCA-COLA SALES DASHBOARD — POWER BI PROJECT


📊 PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------------------------------------------
This Power BI project analyzes sales performance data
for Coca-Cola products using an interactive dashboard.
The goal is to convert raw sales data into clear and
actionable business insights related to revenue trends,
regional performance, and product behavior over time.

The dashboard is built to support exploratory analysis
and data-driven decision-making.


🎯 BUSINESS CONTEXT
----------------------------------------------------
The business operates in a high-volume, low-price sales
model, where understanding seasonal trends, regional
differences, and product performance is essential for
optimizing sales and distribution strategies.

This project helps stakeholders quickly identify
performance patterns and revenue drivers.


📈 KEY METRICS (KPIs)
----------------------------------------------------
• Total Revenue ≈ 968K
• Total Units Sold ≈ 2M
• Average Price per Unit ≈ 0.43

These metrics indicate strong sales volume with relatively
low unit pricing.


📅 SALES TREND ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------
• Revenue shows clear seasonal behavior
• Sales peak during summer months (July–August)
• Strong performance is also observed in year-end months
  (November–December)
• Lower sales activity appears during early-year months
  (February–March)

This highlights the impact of seasonality on sales
performance.
